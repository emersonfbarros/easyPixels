# Easy Pixels

##Why?

This is a small project that came about in my web development studies. As I'm at the very beginning of this path I used only HTML, basic CSS and vanilla JavaScript.

In this project I mainly exercised DOM manipulation through JavaScript and use of localStorage to save user preferences and arts.
Simple app to make pixel 

##What about the future?
I have a lot of ideas to make Easy Pixels a pixel art site with more features but keep it, as the name says, easy. When I acquire more knowledge and have time I will implement things like:

- Color palette where the user can choose the color he wants.
- Possibility to save art.
- Tools like eraser and paint bucket.
